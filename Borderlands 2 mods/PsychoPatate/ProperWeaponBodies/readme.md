### Proper Weapon Bodies V.1.0 (16/08/18) by PsychoPatate
---

#### Intro
Why does green Bandit shotguns and pistols appear to have bigger mag than blue weapons ?
That doesn't make sense to me, so this mod fixes that.

#### What does it do ?
- Swaps green and blue bodies on some weapon types.
- Allows you to customize the few weapons that have unique bodies.
- **THIS MOD ONLY CHANGES THE APPEARANCE OF WEAPONS, NO ACTUAL STATS ARE AFFECTED.**

#### About green and blue bodies :
By default, this mod only changes pistols (not Tediore ones) and shotguns bodies.  
The other weapon types are named as "Not recommended", not because it will break things, but because it doesn't look good.  
But you can swap whatever weapon type you want, just by enabling/disabling lines using BLCMM.

#### About unique bodies :
Some weapons have unique bodies, that means we can change them !  
By default, this mod changes the body of some weapons so it matches their rarity.  
But you can put whatever body variation that you want, or leave unchecked for default look.
