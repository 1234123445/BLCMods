TPS Invulnerable Escortees
==========================

There are a few missions in TPS (nearly all in Lunar Launching Station,
weirdly) in which you must keep either an enemy or an ally alive, or else fail
the mission.  This mod makes those escortees invulnerable, so you no longer
have to worry about inadvertantly failing the mission.  This mod is slightly
less useful than its BL2 counterpart, since most of the escortees in TPS can't
be damaged accidentally by the player, but here it is regardless.

The full list of affected escortees is:

 * **"Lock and Load" Loaders"**: In Lunar Launching Station
 * **"To The Moon" Container"**: Also In Lunar Launching Station
 * **"Things That Go Boom" FIX Loader**: Surprise!  In Lunar Launching
   Station.

Technically CL4P-L3K, from the mission "Eradicate!," could count as an
escortee, but it needs to remain killable, and already has a nice big
health buff.  I've only ever seen it get close to being killed when
I've literally never intervened in any fights, and it can't be harmed
accidentally by the player, so I've left CL4P-L3K to its own devices.
