Infinite Air Boosts
===================

Removes the restriction of one-air-boost-per-jump, so you can just keep on
boosting forever!  Well, that's not *totally* true -- you still need to have
Oxygen in order to boost.  Still, if you're in an atmosphere, you can
pretty much just keep going until your keyboard gives out.

Usage/Installation
==================
