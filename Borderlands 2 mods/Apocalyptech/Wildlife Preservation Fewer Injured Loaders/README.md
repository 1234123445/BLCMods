Wildlife Preservation Fewer Injured Loaders
===========================================

The story mission "Wildlife Preservation" requires you to injure at least
three loaders without killing them, which can be difficult sometimes,
especially in conjunction with skills like Maya's Cloud Kill.  This mod
reduces the required-injured count to 1.  The doors should open once you've
gotten a single loader to be in the "injured" status.

Usage/Installation
==================

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `Wildlife Preservation Fewer Injured Loaders.blcm` and have at it!
