  #1. FFYLAim
  
    -does what the title suggests, allows you to aim while in FFYL!
    
  #2. InfiniteEnemyLoop
  
    -a mod for messing around, it reduces the enemy respawn delay to 0 seconds, causing them to respawn as soon as the area is cleared out.
    
  #3. SlagDamagetoNEDamage
  
    -Changes the 'Slag Damage' attribute to multiplicative Non-Elemental Damage.
    In vanilla, this means all 'slag damage' elemental relics will now have Non-Elemental Damage instead.
    If you have a mod that enables Slag Bone of the Ancients, your Slag Bone of the Ancients will now become Non-ELemental Bone of the Ancients.
    If you have any skill or item that boosts Slag Damage, they will boost Non-Elemental Damage instead.
