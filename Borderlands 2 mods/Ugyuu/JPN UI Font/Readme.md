# BORDERLANDS 2 / PRE-SEQUEL UI FONT MOD

This folder contains the font replacement for the English version of Borderlands 2 / Pre-Sequel. It will replace the original font with a sleeker, thinner font, which looks better in my opinion. It is easier to read, and doesn't clutter as much.

> **This works for The Pre-Sequel as well!**

## NOTES:

The changes to the fonts will revert if you verify the integrity of the game cache through Steam. If this changed back to normal for you, you'll have to install the mod again.

There's a good chance that this font "mod" works for other languages too. You just have to replace the "INT" in "GFxUI.INT" to the name of the folder, of the language you've currently set the game to.

I wish I knew a way to make the game recognize fonts that aren't being used by the game, like Roboto, but I didn't manage to figure that out. Maybe it'll be possible in the future.

## HOW TO INSTALL:

Make sure not to have the game open while doing this. It's not a good idea.

Make a backup of your existing GFxUI.INT before doing this! (It's in Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT) Put it somewhere safe.

Open the GFxUI.INT file in this github folder, then click on Raw.

Right click in the raw file that you've just opened and click "Save As.."

**When downloading this from the GitHub, make sure to select "All Files", when saving the file. If you don't do this, it will save as a TXT and the font change won't work at all.**

Copy the new GFxUI.INT to 'Borderlands 2/WillowGame/Localization/INT' and Paste it in that folder. Choose to replace if you get a notification of this file already existing.

Load your game to make sure that the font has changed. You'll notice it as soon as the first wall of text appears.

Enjoy!
