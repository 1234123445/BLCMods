Unlocked MMORPGFPS
==================

Removes the kill requirements for the three knights in the Dragon Keep
quest "MMORPGFPS."  Now all three knights can be killed in whatever way
you want, and the objectives will increment regardless.  The knight which
ordinarily requires teabagging (`xxDatVaultHuntrxx`) will get auto-teabagged
once its intermediate death animation has completed.

One interesting thing I discovered while doing this is that for the sniper
headshot knight, `[720NoScope]Headshotz`, a "correct" kill on *any* knight
will advance that objective.  So you could get a sniper headshot on any
other knight on the map to complete that objective, even `420_E-Sports_Masta`,
the knight who usually requires a melee kill.  `xxDatVaultHuntrxx` (the
teabag knight) is the one exception to that, since the pawn doesn't really
die in the usual way.  Anyway, with this mod active, that bug is far more
obvious.  Note that if you arrive at the area having alrady completed that
objective, `[720NoScope]Headshotz` will be friendly towards you and actually
help you fight off the others.  That does not seem to get in the way of
mission completion, though.
