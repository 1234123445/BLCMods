FOR EVERY KIND OF BADASS

This is a collection of gear representing some Battleborn characters.

Note: These weapons can be very powerful. Use at your own risk of losing / gaining fun.
Also, since I'm not updating these anymore, there's a good chance that there will be incompatibilities or bugs.

This gear is made to replicate the character, it's weapon and the skills that they use, all put into the single gear piece made for them.

Melee characters not included.
