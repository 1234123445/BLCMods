Always Active Friendship Gulag Searchlights
===========================================

Makes the searchlights in Friendship Gulag be always active, regardless of time
of day.  This makes the "In the Middle of the Night" challenge (now renamed
"In the Middle of Whenever") achievable during the day.

This will, of course, give you some extra things to shoot at while spending
some time in the Friendship Gulag.

Usage/Installation
==================
