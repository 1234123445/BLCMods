There is a little puzzle in Lair of Infinite Agony where the player
must traverse a short hallway with four sections of the floor which
cycle up and down, threatening to crush the player.  It's not a
difficult puzzle, but waiting around and instadeath aren't what I
play Borderlands for.  This mod disables them!
