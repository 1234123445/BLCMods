Guaranteed Omnd-Omnd-Ohk
========================

This is a mod which sets the evolution probability of Badass Savages into
Omnd-Omnd-Ohk to 100% regardless of player count and playthrough.  This
means that every Badass Savage left alive in the presence of a Witch Doctor
for long enough will get evolved into Omnd-Omnd-Ohk.  This would be mostly
useful if you're looking to farm OOO but don't want to gamble on the spawn
each time.

Note that UCP 4.0 includes a section which improves the evolution chances
generally, without going as overboard as this mod does.

Usage
=====

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `Guaranteed Omnd-Omnd-Ohk.blcm` and have at it!
