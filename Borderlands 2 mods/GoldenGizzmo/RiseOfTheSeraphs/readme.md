Rise Of The Seraphs
Created by GoldenGizzmo

This mod is a seraph overhaul that aims to bring a fresh experience to the late game, replacing gear I thought were uncreative or underwhelming, with my own gear and even featuring some special guests too.

NOTE: This mod uses hotfixes, you must add this as a mod in filter tool for the drops to work.

IMPORTANT: Since the 4.1 Patch, you will need to disable the Afterburner buff under UCP 4.1/GearChanges/Relics.
           Because of the changes from the patch, it will mess with the Monster of the Serahps physcial look, however it still functions            the same.

Includes:
- 10 New Weapons (Including Aaron0000's Destroyer, Battle Bee's Pulverizer and B33PB00PJOE's Florentine)
- 2 New Grenades
- 3 New Shields
- 3 New Relics
- Reshuffles all seraph lootpools to fit suit the new gear, vendors and bosses now have different drops
- Raid bosses drops a lot more crystals on death now, so vendor seraphs are now little bonuses, not gear to grind an hour for
- New skins for old seraphs to better fit the theme of the new ones
- Buffs and fixes to old seraphs 
- Replaces the Might of the Seraphs with the Afterburner relic due to Might not being very editable

You may have noticed that the Hoplite is missing, for some currently unknown reason, the Hoplite obliterates any lootpool it's placed in, so for now, you'll have to get it before executing the mod, or gibb.

However once I figure out how to add it back, I'll update the mod.
