NOTE: The following Changes are as a transition from BETA v6.0 to BETA v7.0.







Time for a new update: Turret Terror!

This update is focused on the Turret, and making it a better, more reliable asset.

The changes are as follows:

General:

Updated Mod Description
Some Skills now affect the Turret as well as Axton. You'll know which skills are affected by this.
Skills which boost the Turret now boost both the Scorpio Turret (Base Action Skill) and Gemini (Second turret).
And if a Skill doesn't say it also buffs the Turret, it doesn't.

The vanilla effects of Laser Sight and Longbow Turret now are part of the base Action Skill (Meaning you have both at level 5).
No, Laser Sight does not actually decrease rotation speed or anything, all it does is increase Accuracy.

Separated Code in the Setup Category into two sections, Free up AttributePresentationDefinition (Very important), and Skill Icon Changes.

New Skills:

Auto Repair (Replaces Laser Sight): Grants your Turret Health Regeneration, +2% Per level.

Titanium Turret (Replaces Last Ditch Effort): Increases Maximum Health and reduces Damage Taken for the Turret.

Better Bullets (Replaces Longbow Turret): Increases the Turret's Damage and gives it Critical Hit Bonus.



Other Skill Changes:
Crisis Management: Now can choose the Crisis Management Rework Option, which increases Health Regeneration and Mobility (Movement Speed and Jump Height) while your shield is depleted.
Guns and Glory: Changed name to Glory, and added the option for stacks to Never decay, or decay after 5 minutes per stack (They decay independently of one another. There is nothing I can do about this.)
If you set to Never Decay, they'll only go away upon exiting the game.

Double Up: Now also makes the Turret deal Adaptive Damage. Is an enemy weak to fire? Turret's bullets are fire upon hitting it. Corrosive? Yep, same with Shock and generic surfaces.

Scorched Earth: Removed Bullet Damage Reduction because apparently it had that, which is stupid. Rocket Damage is now boosted by Axton's Grenade Damage Skills.

QuickCharge: Skill now reverted with increased Shield Regeneration Rate.

Duty Calls: Increased Bonuses by an additional 1% per point.

Pressure: Now can choose between the Fast Reflexes skill and Pressure Rework options. Fast Reflexes Reduces Enemy Movement Speed, Firerate and Projectile Speed. Pressure Rework causes bonuses to be active while your Shield is Depleted.

Forbearance: Now can choose between the Forbearance Tweak and Reap And Regenerate options. Forbearance Tweak simply replaces Max Health with Extra FFYL Time. Reap And Regenerate Grants Lifesteal based on Damage Dealt (Like a Moxxi Weapon i.e Grog Nozzle) as well as Passive Ammo Regeneration.

Ranger: Fixed Skill AttributePresentation issues with the UCP Compatibility Mode.

Skill Swapping: Changed locations of Glory, Nuke, Better Bullets, Onslaught (Whatever skill change you choose), and DoOrDie. This change applies to both Standalone and Compatibility Mode.

And there are likely a few other changes that I forgot to or don't care to mention. It's not hard to figure out yourself.
