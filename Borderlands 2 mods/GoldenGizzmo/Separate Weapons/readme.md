Welcome to my weapon collection!

This is where I'll be keeping all my seperate new weapons that I've created.

Currently Includes:

[-- **The Capacitor** --]

- Replaces the Triquetra
- An E-tech Jakobs shotgun
- Has no element and shoots like a normal shotgun, except with blaster shots
- The magazine size is as big as the max ammo carry load, removing reloading
- However to add new ammo, you need to reload
- Overtime ammo will regenerate

- This whole idea is represented in the description as "charge".
- To fit the energy gimmick, reloading adds charge back into the weapon, over time the weapon stockpiles charge to reload.
- Since Jakobs hates weaponry that aren't 'normal', they treat this weapon as a forbidden alien artifact that should be locked away from   public view, similar   to America and the rumours of Area 51.
- Since the weapon has an almost endless magazine size, the player can really just mash the shoot button, of course it's only really       effective at close range.

- Special credit to Exotek for fixing the flaps and some skin errors

[-- **The Gizzmo** --]

- Replaces the Pocket Rocket
- Shoots 2 bullets instead of 1
- A torgue pistol that fires like a Jakobs pistol

- This is the first gun i've ever made, and it's named after my cat, just like my username.
- Since the weapon fires like a Jakobs pistol, the DPS acheived can be very high if the player is good at mashing.
- The gun is purple rarity to stand out in the Torgue Vendors.
- Now shoots standard Torgue gyrojets to be more compatible with other mods.

[-- **Java Powerhouse** --]

- Replaces the Black Hole
- A huge change to the Black Hole shield
- Lower capacity
- Insanely high recharge rate
- Higher recharge delay
- Much higher nova damage

- The shield is a mixture of the Black Hole, Rapid Release and Supernova.
- It's now made for a much higher offense.
- The recharge rate is increase in order for the nova to proc more often.
- Mostly nova shields do dissapointing damage at higher levels, hence the massive increase in power, yet it's not insane enough to make   Gaige invincible.

[-- **The Koffee** --]

- Replaces the Roaster
- Only comes in fire element
- Fires around 10 Bandit e-tech rockets
- The projectiles are slow moving and arch pretty hard

- This weapon is of course based off coffee.
- When you fire, you shoot a giant blob of purple lava-like prazma that's a little hot.
- The projectile arch pretty hard, so the main goal was to trade range for damage.
- Meaning that you need to fire this weapon differently to achieve success.
- Also since it's a Bandit e-tech, the prazma melts, leaving residue, adds to the liquid-like theme in my eyes.

[-- **The Switch It!** --]

- Replaces the Deliverence
- Only shoots one bullet
- Has a magazine size of 1
- On reload, throws 10 shotguns

- So obviously the gimmick with this weapon is that I've swapped the bullets fired with the guns thrown.
- Hence the name.
- Also the design of the gun looked similar to a bunch of Nintendo Switches being thrown around.
- Since Switch fits the name, I then also made the gun have the same colour scheme.
- This gun is not meant for shooting, but chucking like other tediore weapons.
