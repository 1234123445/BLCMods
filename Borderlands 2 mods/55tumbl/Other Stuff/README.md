## Overview

**`fixUCPerrors.blcm`**
This small mod fixes the few "overwrite" errors (the ones that appear in orange in the UCP when using BLCMM 1.1.6 in developer mode). 
More precisely, it makes the buffs to C0unter Strike and the Crit, which had so far no effect at all, work as intended.
Same for the Pot'o'Gold (although the money drops still don't scale, but that's another issue).
These fixes will probably be included in UCP 4.1.1, but in the meantime you can just import `fixUCPerrors.blcm` as a single mod.

**`fixVoracHyperiusHealth.blcm`**
This small mod addresses an issue with Vorac and Hyperius (plus minions) having double health (before level scaling) since the Lilith DLC and latest level cap increase. This was definitely unintended by the devs, but due to some balance modifiers that applies only to players with one or two (but not three, apparently) level cap increases.
