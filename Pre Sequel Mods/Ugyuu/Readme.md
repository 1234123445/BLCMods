# Ugyuu's Pre-Sequel Mods

Hello! Here you will find some of my first ever mods.
## Be aware that these mods are currently HEAVILY OUTDATED.
I am slowly working on updating all of the mods. Make sure to check back here in a while.

**Note for newcomers: My mods are slightly stronger than your usual items, apart from the Chronicler of Elpis class mods.**

Thank you for stopping by! Message me on Discord if you have any questions about my mods.

Did you know that my UI Font Mod works for Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel as well? [Click here to check it out!](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/Ugyuu/JPN%20UI%20Font)
