Loot Container Testing
======================

Used when trying to get a handle once and for all on the particulars of the weighting
system in loot, and to make sure that my Better Loot definitions were doing what I
thought they were doing.  Affects various specific maps, and is a bit janky, but
whatever.

The source generation file contains some other commented stuff which is tangential
at best.

Anyway, not really a useful mod per se, but I'd wanted to keep it around in case
I wanted to do more mass chest spawning again.
