This mod vastly improves the starting accuracy of all Hyperion weapons,
and greatly decreases the time it takes for them to reach peak accuracy.
This is most notable with pistols, SMGs, and sniper rifles, though
shotguns received a small buff as well.  Sniper rifles in particular
have basically no initial sway to the targetting, so Hyperion snipers
aren't totally useless anymore.  The Bitch, which already had its own
buffs to accuracy, basically starts off as accurate as it can be.

This mod obviously makes Hyperion weaponry rather OP -- it should really
be paired with a mod to decrease damage or otherwise make up for the
lack of a downside for Hyperion weapons, but I've never been one for
worrying about using OP weapons.

I've left comments in the mod with the default values for what I've
changed.  If you want to improve Hyperion weapons but not as much as
what I've done, feel free to modify!
