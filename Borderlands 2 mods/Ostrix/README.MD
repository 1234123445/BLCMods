Welcome to my mods!

All mods are made by me unless stated otherwise. Credit to those who helped with my mods are present where due.

Unfortunately the development of all my mods have been postponed indefinitely until a few conditions are met, such as being motivated. So until I feel like it I will not be updating mods like Axton Revisited further. I have ideas for it and I want to do it, but I lack the motivation.

Please do not reupload my mods anywhere else, if you want to share them with a friend, link them here.

Otherwise, if you want to use or modify my code, please let me know on discord: OstrixTheOstrich#7113

Thank you and have a great day!
