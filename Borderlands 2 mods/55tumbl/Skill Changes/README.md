# Phaselock Tweaks

This mod includes 3 different alterations to Phaselock's behavior. Each one can be (de)selected independently of the others.

* **Always activate Wreck/Elated/Chain Reaction**: this only affects the behaviour of Phaselock against targets that are immune to it. It does not change anything about the way Phaselock works with regular targets. After hitting a non-phaselockable target, Phaselock remains artificially active for the base phaselock duration of 5 seconds (not affected by Suspension). During that time, Chain Reaction, Elated, and Wreck are active (if specced into) and give all their bonuses. Phaselock cooldown will only start after this phase is finished (even if not specced into Wreck/Elated/Chain Reaction)

* **Delay Helios so that it happens after Converge and Ruin**: This makes Helios proc 1.25 seconds later in the Phaselock chain of events. The initial Helios explosion should now happen after the target is slagged. To be honest, it really does not change much since about 80% of Helios' damage is in the Burn DOT (which did already benefit from Ruin's slag). What's probably a much bigger deal is that Helios now also happens after Converge, and may thus hit more enemies.

* **Give Helios its visual effects**: This is purely visual: fixed a bug (I think) that deleted what seem to be the visual effects intended for Helios.


### Compatibility
This Phaselock Tweak is compatible with the Skill Scaling Patch.
It should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch Phaselock behaviour. There shouldn't be any compatibility issues with the UCP. It is definitely not compatible with my Elemental Banshee Maya

### Credits

Thanks to Orudeon for encouraging me to get some more phaselock BPD fun.

* [2018-09-08] v1.0.





# Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf

The **Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf** nerfs Cloud Kill, uh well, dynamically. That is, Cloud Kill gets nerfed *a lot* in the early levels, and *a lot less* (or pretty much not at all) in the end game. Several options are available.

### Compatibility
The Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf is compatible with the Skill Scaling Patch.
It should be compatible with most other mods, as long as they do not touch Cloud Kill and/or Blight Phoenix.
If they do touch Cloud Kill and/or Blight Phoenix, it will probably still be fine as long as you add the Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf at the end. It may also not be fine at all. (Note that, in practice, Blight Phoenix is left unchanged by this mod.. it did lose a few of its internal organs, but with no noticeable consequences).

One of the options of the Cloud Kill Dynamic Nerf (True Maya) is included as an optional nerf in the Unofficial Community Patch, as of version 4.1.

### Options

**Normal Maya**    
Cloud Kill does about 10% of its damage at level 16, 18% at level 30, 41% at level 50, 79% at level 72, 95% at OP8.

**True Maya**    
Cloud Kill does about 10% of its damage at level 16, 17% at level 30, 36% at level 50, 65% at level 72, 78% at OP8.

**Ultimate Maya**    
Cloud Kill does about 7% of its damage at level 16, 12% at level 30, 27% at level 50, 52% at level 72, 63% at OP8.

### Known Issues

The Cloud Kill damage ends up being in part calculated from the level of the game, rather than the level of Maya herself.
For example, if you join the game of a lower/higher level player, your Cloud Kill damage will adapt (to some extent), and be lower/higher than it would have been in a perfect world. I don't think this should be really problematic in practice.

### Credits

This was all written by me.

Thanks to the Order of the Impending Storm for balancing Cloud Kill so well in the first place.

### Change log
* [2018-07-18] v1.1: Switched to BLCMM-compatible format.
* [2018-06-27] v1.0.
